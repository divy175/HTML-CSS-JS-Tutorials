# Learning Repository: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Welcome to my learning repository for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This repository documents my journey and progress in mastering these essential web development technologies. It includes solutions to various coding challenges, implementation examples, and notes to help others learn alongside me.

## Repository Structure

### Questions
Each topic or challenge is described in the `README.md` file under the **"Challenges"** section. These challenges are designed to help reinforce the concepts and techniques Iâ€™m learning as I go along.

### Solutions
All answers and implementations are included as separate code files for each question. These files are named according to the pattern `question<number>.html` or `question<number>.js` to make it easy to locate and reference specific exercises.

## 2.5: JavaScript Control Structures

In file `2.5.js`, I focus on learning and practicing various JavaScript control structures. The key concepts I will explore are:

- **do...while** loop
- **else-if** statement
- **forEach** method
- **for** loop
- **if-else** conditional statement
- **switch** statement
- **ternary operator**
- **while** loop

These control structures are essential for creating dynamic, efficient, and flexible JavaScript programs. Each of these concepts is implemented and demonstrated with examples in the corresponding code file.
