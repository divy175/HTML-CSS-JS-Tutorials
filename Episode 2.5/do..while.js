// The do...while loop in JavaScript is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code inside the loop will run at least once, even if the condition is false initially. This is because the condition is checked after the loop executes, rather than before.
// let value = 1
let value2 = 15
// do {
//     console.log(value)
//     value++
// } while (value<10);
do{
    console.log(value2)
    value2++
}while(value2 <10)

// what if the value is false
