      The <code>ins</code> tag in HTML is used to represent inserted text,
      meaning content that has been added to the document. It is typically used
      in scenarios where there is a need to show changes in a document, such as
      when text is added to the original content in a version-controlled
      document or a text comparison. When the tag is used, most browsers will
      render the text with an underline by default to highlight the insertion.
